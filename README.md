## Overview

FaceTrack is an intelligent attendance system built to automate check-ins by recognizing and tracking students‚Äô faces in real time. Powered by libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, and face_recognition, it streamlines the attendance process with accuracy and efficiency, eliminating the need for manual roll calls or sign-ins. Whether in classrooms, training sessions, or events, FaceTrack provides a reliable solution for seamless attendance management.

**Why FaceTrack?**

This project simplifies attendance tracking with an easy-to-use, automated workflow. The core features include:

- üß† **Face Detection & Encoding:** Identifies and encodes student faces for accurate recognition.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Real-Time Processing:** Captures live video streams to mark attendance instantly.
- üîç **Visualization & Annotation:** Displays annotated faces for verification and transparency.
- üìã **Automated Attendance Logs:** Generates organized records without manual intervention.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Seamless Integration:** Can be adapted for schools, universities, or training platforms.
